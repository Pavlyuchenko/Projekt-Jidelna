## [(Project Canteen)](https://pages.github.com/)

Project Canteen is website created using Python microframework *Flask* and *jQuery*. The script scrapes data from canteen page of my school and then shows them with the option to also choose them (this is made possible using *Selenium*). Each user can afterwards rate the meal, which will then help other student to choose next time this meal occurs, because the rating will be displayed with a photo on the "choosing" page. You can also search for meals.

It is basically a simple CRUD application with star rating with comment system built-in and a web scraper aswell.
