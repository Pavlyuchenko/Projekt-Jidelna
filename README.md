## [(Project Canteen)](https://pavlyuchenko.pythonanywhere.com)

Project Canteen is website created using Python microframework *Flask* and *jQuery*. The script scrapes data from canteen page of my school and then shows them with the option to also choose them (this is made possible using *Selenium*). Each user can afterwards rate the meal, which will then help other student to choose next time this meal occurs, because the rating will be displayed with a photo on the "choosing" page. You can also search for meals.

It is basically a simple CRUD application with star rating with comment system built-in and a web scraper aswell.

*Please note that this was the first project using Flask I made, so the code is a mess. The page is also loading long, however there are a lot of features and I am proud of it.*
*Please note that the website is not working properly due to the beginner programme on PythonAnywhere.com, which does not allow scraping data from other websites. Some functions might not work.*
